2018-04-26 14:18:54.395577+0200 TestOpenEars[852:199651] Error: you have invoked the method:

startListeningWithLanguageModelAtPath:(NSString *)languageModelPath dictionaryAtPath:(NSString *)dictionaryPath acousticModelAtPath:(NSString *)acousticModelPath languageModelIsJSGF:(BOOL)languageModelIsJSGF

with a languageModelPath which is nil. If your call to OELanguageModelGenerator did not return an error when you generated this grammar, that means the correct path to your grammar that you should pass to this method's languageModelPath argument is as follows:

NSString *correctPathToMyLanguageModelFile = [myLanguageModelGenerator pathToSuccessfullyGeneratedGrammarWithRequestedName:@"TheNameIChoseForMyVocabulary"];

Feel free to copy and paste this code for your path to your grammar, but remember to replace the part that says "TheNameIChoseForMyVocabulary" with the name you actually chose for your grammar or you will get this error again (and replace myLanguageModelGenerator with the name of your OELanguageModelGenerator instance). Since this file is required, expect an exception or undocumented behavior shortly.
